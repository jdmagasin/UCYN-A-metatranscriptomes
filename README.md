Our study compared metatranscriptomes from natural populations of the nitrogen-fixing, endosymbiotic cyanobacteria UCYN-A that were collected from two very different habitats, the nutrient-poor North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (at Stn. ALOHA) and the nutrient-rich waters off the California coast (at Scripps Pier).  UCYN-A is an important source of fixed nitrogen to marine microbial communities.  An obligate endosymbiont, UCYN-A exchanges fixed nitrogen for carbon from its haptophyte host, which is photosynthetic (unlike UCYN-A).  For our study, metatranscritomes were obtained for samples collected over ~2-days with 3 to 6 hours between samples in order to study day-night gene expression patterns.  Differences in expression patterns across habitats improve our understand of differences among the ecotypes and their respective hosts (which differ among sublineages).

The Scripps Pier metatranscriptomes were previously reported by [Muñoz-Marín et al. (2019 in mBio)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02495-18).  The Stn. ALOHA data are new.  Both studies used custom UCYN-A microarrays that targeted major UCYN-A ecotypes UCYN-A1 (open ocean ecotype) and UCYN-A2 (coastal ecotype).  The Stn. ALOHA data used an updated microarray design that included known genes for UCYN-A3 (open ocean ecotype).
