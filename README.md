The nitrogen-fixing, endosymbiotic cyanobacterium _Atelocyanobacterium thalassa_ ("UCYN-A") can contribute substantial amounts of fixed nitrogen to marine microbial communities. Because nitrogen is scare over much of the world ocean, UCYN-A and other "diazotrophs" are critical for fixing atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> into biologically usable forms. UCYN-A genomes are extremely reduced and, unlike most cyanobacteria, UCYN-A cannot fix carbon through photosynthesis. However, UCYN-A obtains carbon from its haptophyte (and photosynthetic) host in exchange for fixed nitrogen.

Our study compared metatranscriptomes from natural populations of UCYN-A that were collected from two very different habitats, the nutrient-poor North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (at Stn. ALOHA) and the nutrient-rich waters off the California coast (at Scripps Pier). For our study, metatranscritomes were obtained for samples collected over ~2-days with 3 to 6 hours between samples in order to study day-night gene expression patterns.  Differences in expression patterns across habitats can improve our understanding of differences among UCYN-A ecotypes and their specific hosts (which differ among sublineages).

The Scripps Pier metatranscriptomes were previously reported by [Muñoz-Marín et al. (2019 in mBio)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02495-18).  The Stn. ALOHA data are new.  Both studies used custom UCYN-A microarrays that targeted major UCYN-A ecotypes UCYN-A1 (open ocean ecotype) and UCYN-A2 (coastal ecotype).  The Stn. ALOHA data used an updated microarray design that included known genes for UCYN-A3 (open ocean ecotype).
