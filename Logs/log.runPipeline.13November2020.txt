WARNING: Found no negative control genes in ALOHA_Mari.quantilesNorm.medianpolishGene.  If the array has no negative controls then this is fine. If it does have negative controls, then maybe you are running stage 5 asecond time.  Negative control genes are deleted from esets at the end of stage 5 so that they do not influence stage 6, differential expression. See the excludeGenesString configuration parameter.  I will continue, but I will use the bottom intensity genes to set the detection thresholds for each sample.

Comparing genes detected by pipeline to the ERCC.
[1] TRUE
[1] TRUE

Will now use the ERCC analysis to filter the 2753 genes detected by the pipeline.
 Will keep genes that were detected by the pipeline and that also satisfy one or both of the following
 two tests in at least 4 samples:
   1. The gene's observed level was above the observed level for the least concentrated ERCC.,
      Mari estimated 43 transcripts before amplification for this ERCC.
   2. The gene's predicted intensity is > the predicted intensity for the least concentrated ERCC.
The following table shows how many genes will pass the tests.  SampsAbove43mRNA counts the number
 of genes that pass test #2 in n=0,1,..16 samples. SampsAboveLowestERCC counts the genes that pass
 test #1.

Counting DE genes shared by different types of sample comparisons.  Also will draw a Venn diagram to show this.

The range of log fold changes found by FindZlimForGeneOrganismMaps() is (-4.45290777526097, 4.98178270772712). I will use the symmetric range (-4.981783, 4.981783).

Warning message:
In TrimEsetToDetectedGenes(eset, detGenes) :
  TrimEsetToDetectedGenes found some detected genes that are not in the eset.

Done with with the usual pipeline stages!


Looking for periodic genes (Fourier analysis) using findCyclicGenes.R. The output will be in CyclicAnalysis, including a separate log file.
[1] TRUE
[1] TRUE


Will not do an additional Fourier analysis of ALOHA but will use only the genes and timepoints (mainly) from mBio 2019.  This helps us understand why much more diel genes are detected at SIO than at ALOHA (after controlling for differences in the number of detected genes and timepoints used in the Fourier analysis). The output is in CyclicAnalysis.mbio2019ified, including a separate log file.
[1] TRUE
[1] TRUE
Saving table of detected genes with cyclic status and annotation to detectedGenes.csv
Includes the mean (over replicates) log2 transcript levels.


Totally DONE!  For safekeeping, you should create a directory and move all results to it:
    -- MicroTOOLs pipeline output:  report.html and Output directory
    -- DetectionAnalysis directory from the additional ERCC based gene detection
    -- CyclicAnalysis from the Fourier analysis
    -- CyclicAnalysis.mbio2019ified from the Fourier analysis restricted to mBio 2019
       genes and timepoints
