Later we will use the AR1 background model to get the same autocorrelation anyway. Let's check whether autocorrelation is high enough to worry about...

Now the real work.  For each gene calculate its Fourier score and FDR using the AR1 background model.  Make 1000 background data sets.  Get some coffee!
